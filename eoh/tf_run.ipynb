By upscaling fish waste, we can reduce the environmental impact of fish processing and disposal. For instance, using fish waste as a raw material for biogas production helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and decrease the reliance on fossil fuels, supporting \\nsustainable aquaculture. Utilizing fish waste in aquaculture helps to create a closed-loop system, where fish waste is used to fertilize the growth of fish feed or crops that can be used in fish feed. \\n\\nEconomic benefits: Upscaling fish waste utilization creates new business opportunities and jobs in the fisheries sector. It provides a cheaper source of raw materials for the production of value-added products namely fish oil, fish meal, and fish-based food products.  \\n\\nSocial benefits: Fish waste utilization contributes to food security by providing a source of protein for animal feed and for human consumption. It also provides new revenue streams/ income source for small-scale fishers and fish processors by reducing waste and improving resource efficiency by creating value-added  products from fish waste such as fish meal, fish oil, and fertilizers.\\n    - **Have you obtained proof of concept for your project?** Yes\\n\\n    Solution Summary: This application proposes to upscale the utilization of fish waste to create a more sustainable and equitable food system. The project aims to address the issue of food waste and hunger by transforming fish waste into valuable products like fish feed, dysphagia meals, and toddler meals.  The project plans to achieve this by developing optimized formulations, refining processing methods, and scaling up production. By creating a circular economy where waste is repurposed and reused, the project aims to reduce environmental impact, promote sustainable nutrition, and create new economic opportunities in the fisheries sector. The project seeks funding to further develop and commercialize its technology, ultimately creating a more sustainable and equitable food system for all. \\n\\n\\n    Proposed solution: The proposed solution to address fish waste utilization is to upscale the production of various value-added products from fish waste, including puree food for kids, ready-to-eat meals, base broth or sauce for the kitchen, fish feed and more. By utilizing fish by-products such as eyes, heads, collars, skin, and bones, it is possible to reduce food waste, promote sustainability, and provide more affordable and nutritious food options.\\n\\nThe process of upscaling the production of these products would involve collecting fish waste from local fish processing companies and transforming it into value-added products using specialized equipment and processes. For example, the fish waste could be ground up and processed into a puree for use in baby food, or cooked and chilled for use in ready-to-eat meals.\\n\\nOne of the key advantages of this approach is that it helps to create a more circular economy, where waste products are repurposed and reused rather than being sent to landfills or incinerated. Additionally, by providing more affordable and nutritious food options, this solution could help to reduce food insecurity and malnutrition in many communities.\\n\\nOverall, the proposed solution to address fish waste utilization has the potential to create a more sustainable and equitable food system, while also reducing waste and promoting economic growth.\\n\\n    Proposed project\\'s scope of work: The proposed scope of works include:\\n\\nFormulation development: This involves developing formulations and optimized for taste, texture, nutrition, and shelf-life.\\n\\nProcessing optimization: This involves optimizing the processing methods for the different products. \\n\\nProduct testing: This involves testing the products to ensure that they meet the required standards for safety, quality, and nutrition - testing for contaminants, such as heavy metals and toxins, and nutritional testing.\\n\\nScaling up production: This includes sourcing of raw materials, setting up production facilities, and implementing quality control processes.\\n\\nCommercialization: This involves bringing the products to market and developing partnerships with potential customers and distributors.\\n\\nOverall, the scope of work for upscaling fish waste involves a comprehensive approach to product development, processing optimization, quality control, and commercialization. It requires collaboration between different stakeholders, including researchers, producers, distributors, and customers, to create a sustainable and viable solution for reducing food waste and addressing food security challenges.\\n    \\n        Please provide your response in the following JSON format:\\n    ```json\\n    {{\\n        \"decision\": \"Yes/No/Maybe\",\\n        \"comment\": \"Your detailed assessment explaining the decision\"\\n    }}\\n    ```'},\n",
