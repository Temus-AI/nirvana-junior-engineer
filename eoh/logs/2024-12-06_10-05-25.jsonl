Based on the evaluation output, I'd like to provide some feedback to improve the system prompt.\n\nSince the language model correctly identified the typo in the input sentence, it's clear that the model is capable of processing and analyzing text. However, the prompt could be more specific and targeted to encourage the model to provide more accurate and relevant responses.\n\nHere's a suggested improvement:\n\n<VARIABLE> Identify and correct the error in the given sentence </VARIABLE>\n\nThis revised prompt is more specific and task-oriented, which could lead to more accurate and relevant responses from the language model. By using the phrase \"Identify and correct,\" the prompt provides a clear direction for the model to follow, which could help it focus on the specific task at hand.\n\nAdditionally, the revised prompt could be further refined to include more context or guidance for the model. For example:\n\n<VARIABLE> Identify and correct the error in the given sentence, providing a clear explanation of the mistake and the corrected sentence </VARIABLE>\n\nThis revised prompt provides more context and guidance for the model, which could help it generate more accurate and informative responses.\n\nOverall, by refining the system prompt to be more specific and task-oriented, we can encourage the language model to provide more accurate and relevant responses, which could ultimately improve the objective function.",
